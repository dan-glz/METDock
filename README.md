# METDock
This tool is still a work in progress and is expected to be resumed starting January 2026

## Overview

METDock: Molecular Evolutionary Trends Docking is a Python-based pipeline for preparing phylogenetically related proteins and their respective ligands for usage with AutoDock Vina. The pipeline is designed to automate the process for large protein and ligand datasets. It leverages existing interfaces and software while streamlining preparation, reducing time spent on docking-related tasks, and allowing more time for result analysis.

## Pipeline

### 1. Selection of Proteins and Preparation of Spreadsheet

### 2. Preparation of PDBs

### 3. Preparation of Ligands

### 4. Single Ligand Docking through AutoDock Vina
